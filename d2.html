        <h1>Audio/Sound/Music</h1><br>
        <h2>Audio mixing in our minds and how it shapes our everyday lives</h2><br>
        <h3>One of the five senses of humans is hearing. Therefore, sound makes up an entire 20% of our lives and everything we experience. So how much of our lives are shaped by what we hear? How would things be different if tangible audio didn’t exist? Sure, music wouldn’t exist, but that is simply one small fraction of the types of audio we experience each day. This concept is meant to not only question the things that we hear every day and take for granted, but challenge us to put ourselves in the place of someone who lives out this soundless reality everyday, like a deaf person.
An audio engineer takes sound from multiple audio sources, and compresses it down into one mix that is then used to reproduce the sound, where different sources are heard at different volume levels and some may be drowned out entirely. This is true for the sound engineer at a live concert mixing instruments and vocal mics, as well as for an audio guy at a sports venue trying to mix the commentators talking with the crowd noise with the sound of the action on the field. How do we engineer sound in our own lives? What audio do we hear daily that we drown out and completely ignore, and what sounds do our brains naturally pay attention to? Are there things that we don’t quite hear correctly but we are still able to fill in the missing gaps with our minds? What are frequencies in audio and how do they affect all of this? These are questions I hope to challenge with this concept.</h3>
