                <h1>How Our Mind Fills In The Gaps In Sound</h1>
                <h2>Sometimes the way our minds are trained, we will hear things in our minds even if the sound waves weren't actually making that sound. Different people fill in audio gaps with different things in their minds, it's what makes us unique.<br>
                    <br>
                    Can you think of ways that your mind fills in gaps with sound? Maybe someone is talking to you on the phone, but the service quality is poor, and every few words you can't hear what they're saying, but you still can get the idea of what they're saying because your mind "guesses" at the words they said that you couldn't hear. This same idea can even be applied to muting a TV. For TV programs you've seen multiple times, it's probably easy to hear in your mind what the actors are saying, even if the volume on the TV isn't on at all. This is an example of your brain filling in silence with sounds you're familiar with from memory.<br>

                The above video comes from Jimmy Kimmel's segment on his show called "Unneccesary Censorship". In the feature, various video clips of people talking are taken, and bleeps are put in specific places to make it sound like that person used a curse word even though they didn't. Even though your ears are only hearing a bleep, your mind is processing phrases that it is used to hearing and placing those curse words in the place of the bleep even though you didn't hear them. Watch the video and count how many times you think you hear a word you didn't actually hear.

                <h2>In <i>Retroactive I</i>, Rauschenberg discovers synchronicity between images and brings them together in a collage in a juxtaposition to create a statement on the relationship between the images, but allows the viewer to define the relationship and fill in the gap without explicitly defining one himself. In same way with sound, we often fill in the gap in our minds with sounds we didn't actually hear, making our own opinions of whatever we might have heard.</h2>
