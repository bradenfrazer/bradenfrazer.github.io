                <h1>Music</h1>
                <h2>Music is a huge part of society today and can really affect how a person lives life. Music can be a hobby (playing instruments, DJing) or be seen as a means of expression (i.e. a person who listens to classical music usually has a relaxed type of personality). Music builds on what has been discussed about audio mixers and different venues because both factor in to how music is experienced. Music can be heard through recordings played on an mp3 player or can be experienced live in concert, two completely different venues, and sound mixes, but both requiring an audio mixer. <br></h2>

It's introduction in the early 2000's marked one of the first times a device would let a person carry 1,000s of songs with them wherever they were at. </p><br>

                Above is a commonly known song, Freebird. With what you've learned, play the song and listen to it and think about what makes up it's sound. All of the different instruments and vocals in the sound were mixed down and recorded in a specific way. It's also worth noting, the way you hear this song and what sticks out to you may be different than someone else's experience.

                <h2>In the "Garden of Forking Paths", Borges explores how multiple paths can lead back to the same place, and the possibility of running in cycles. This is similar to how audio can be reached through multiple paths (different locations, for instance), as well as the concept of recording music, which allows us to replay or "cycle" back to a previous experience over and over again.</h2>
