                <h1>Fashion</h1>
                <h2>Music and audio can be used as a means of fashion and therefore expression. Wearing headphones for some people is all about the brand and looking like a music junkie, not necessarily what the headphones sound like. Some people like to broadcast on social media through what music they're listening to, showing off their music preferences. Even though audio/sound is about hearing, it has now also developed a "look". 
                    Considering music as a fashion really turns sound and its fundamentals on its head, taking us from the sense of hearing to a visual sense of what we see. Sound as a fashion can take on many forms - anything from wearing iconic Beats headphones (pictured right) around one's neck even when they're not playing anything, to wearing band t-shirts - and while it doesn't really have an actual audio component, these types of fashion couldn't have come about without the role of sound and music being what they are in our lives.  <br></h2>

                Spotify is a popular online music streaming service. As seen in the photo above, Spotify gives users the options to publish what they're listening to on social media, giving another perspective of this concept of music being a defining outer characteristic of ourselves more than just being something personal and private.

                Beats headphones are one of many headphone brands that have become more common in recent years, but have the unique attribute of having arguably just as much function as a brand as a listening device. Many critics believe Beats' quality is on par of that of many sub-$100 headphones, yet many of their products start at $200 or more. This premium price range has resulted in Beats becoming much more of a status symbol and it's not uncommon to see people in public walking around with these headphones around their neck, not even using them for their intended purpose.

                <h2>Marcel Duchamp's <i>Fountain</i> was a very important piece of art in the 20th century, causing those in the Dada movement to question what art truly is. Duchamp's act of purchasing a urinal and then signing his name on it, changing its meaning and proclaiming it as art is very similar to music as a fashion today, where many people have changed the roles of items such as headphones from the purpose of listening to them to a symbol of status.</h2>
