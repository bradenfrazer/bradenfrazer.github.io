                <h1>Experiential Input</h1>
                <h2>As a person who has mixed sound for choir concerts, church services, and live sports broadcasts, I have experience in mixing sound in various productions and venues. Mixing sound changes depending on the production and room. Different rooms have different acoustics: typically larger rooms have more echo. Different productions have a different type of mix as well. In-house mixing usually means amplifying audio sources, adding to what is already present in the room. Audio for broadcast or streaming is different, where the mix completely starts from scratch audio-wise.<br>
                    <br>
                    These types of mixing mentalities can be applied to every day life, wherein different situations, we "mix" audio in our minds and choose to listen to or not listen to certain things depending on where we are locationally. We can mix audio in our minds similiar to mixing live audio in public places where a lot of noise is going on, like a train station, by picking and choosing in our minds what to focus on. Likewise we can also start from scratch in our minds, if we're in a quiet place like a bedroom, choosing what sounds we hear by what we listen to, like if a TV is turned on or not. <br></h2>

                This screenshot from a broadcast of a football game between A&M and Miss St. is an example of some of my experiential input and a production that would start from scratch audio wise. This is because any person that watches the broadcast is physically too far away from the game to hear it, and their experience of the game is based on whatever mics and music the audio engineer for the broadcast chooses to make live.

                <h2>Landow shed light on the concept of context, how any text presented alongside references or other information can warp it's meaning. Context is extremely important in the realms on the audio world too. Audio in the context of a classical orchestra concert has a completely different meaning and feel than audio in the context of a live sports venue. In the former you would expect to hear instrumental music and quiter sound, while at a sporting event you expect to hear the action of the players on the field and the crowd yelling loudly in the stands.</h2>
