                <h1>Audio Mixing</h1>
                <h2>Audio mixing is something that is physically done on a sound console, taking audio sources and giving them certain volume levels to create an overall mix or "feel" to the sound. It is a great visual representation of how some people like to hear some things more than others (instruments vs. vocals), which is why I have made it my metaphor. It also presents a new idea that people act as audio mixers every day, tuning out some audio (student ignoring professor's lecture) and tuning in others (trying to listen to music in a crowded room).<br><br>
            Mixing audio can be a challenge because it is really up to a sound engineer what mix sounds the best for any certain production. While he might prefer to hear electric guitar riffs loud and piercing through a band's concert mix, one of the audience members might enjoy hearing keyboard more and could be disappointed that the keys are being drowned out by the electric. Audio engineers have to mix sound for what they feel will work best for everyone in the room, even though they are all in different locations and have different preferences. Every day we work as our own audio mixers, by taking all of the things we might hear in a given day, "mixing out" things we normally ignore or take for granted while "mixing in" things that interest us.<br><br>

                A simple image of a typical sound console, this gives a bit of insight to the complexities in sound mixing and how everything that you might hear at a concert or other production have so many variables in how it could be heard. Ever slider and button effects the mix in some way, also effecting how you experience the event.

                <h2>Tufte introduced the concept of layering as a means of simplifying large amounts of information. Recording audio or even taking live audio from multiple sources and mixing it down into a single source is a very simple extention of this idea of layering. Every audio source in a typical band concert - vocals, guitar, keyboard, drums - are all sound that can stand on their own, but mixed together, they are still a single sound that can stand on their own, just layered on top of each other. </h2>
