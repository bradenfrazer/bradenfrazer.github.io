                <h1>How Audio Works</h1>
                <h2>The way sound works fundamentally can give us insight into how we perceive it and how that differs from one person to another. Sound is made out of waves and frequencies, that cause a fluctuation in air pressure that can be recognized by our ears. Every sound that we hear can be simplifed into 3 aspects: volume, tonal content, and environment. As these vary, we can better distinguish certain sounds from others.</h2>

            <p>The above chart shows common sounds we hear at different frequencies. Frequencies determine what a sound "sounds" like, and different people hear different ranges of frequencies. A sound with a low frequency will have a low pitch, like a human heartbeat. A high frequency sound has a high pitch, like a whistle. Most humans hear between 20Hz-2,000Hz.</p>

                This video explains the basics of sound. While it's hard to explain all of the intricacies of sound in 3 minutes, this gives a great overview to understanding how sound works on a fundamental level.

                <h2>Figgis' Timecode was a movie shot with 4 different perspectives all showing at the same time. It showed how different people can have different perspectives simultanously of the same event, and the same is true of audio. No two people ever hear the exact same thing at the same time, because of the way sound bounces off of walls, and the way we choose to "tune in" or "tune out" to different sources of audio in our lives, like ignoring a professor lecturing in class. What kind of perspective do you have of sound in your life every day?</h2>
